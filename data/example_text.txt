DNA replicati12341on is the process by which DNA m!!!!akes a copy of itself during cell division. The fir6547st step in DNA replication is the separation of the two DNA strands that make up the helix. Next, DNA polymerases add complementary nucleotid£$%^es to ea12324ch strand which results 123123in the formation of t£$""wo identical DNA molecules. This proce$"ss ensures that each new c3124ell has an exact copy of the DNA molec£$^ule. This is vital for the process of mitosis and meiosis. Enzymes play a crucial role 588in facilitating the unwinding and£"£$ re-winding of the DNA%^^$ strands. It's a very accurate process but errors occasi#';onally occur, leading to mutations" which can sometimes be beneficia123l, harmful, or neutral.
