dna replication is the process by which dna makes a copy of itself during cell division the first step in dna replication is the separation of the two dna strands that make up the helix next dna polymerases add complementary nucleotides to each strand which results in the formation of two identical dna molecules this process ensures that each new cell has an exact copy of the dna molecule this is vital for the process of mitosis and meiosis enzymes play a crucial role in facilitating the unwinding and rewinding of the dna strands its a very accurate process but errors occasionally occur leading to mutations which can sometimes be beneficial harmful or neutral
